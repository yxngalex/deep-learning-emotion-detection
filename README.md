# Emotion detection app

## Description

This is a software that will detect emotion using CNN (`Convolutional neural network`) deep learning algorithm. Which
will be detected using a web camera.

## Requirements

To run this projects you will need

- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Numpy

you can install all these packages using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Conclusion

This app was a first look, an introduction, to artificial intelligence and it's most popular
methods such as deep learning and machine learning.
While working on this project I learned about CNN and how we use it to detect emotion through images and videos.
I also learned about data training, overfitting and underfitting.
